1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

    The inputs that i gave the simulation are a pop_size of 100000, a vacc_percentage of 90%, the virus_name of Ebola, a mortality_rate of 70% and repro_rate of 25%.

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

    The virus burn out after 40 days and it infected rouchly 20% of the population being infected before the virus burned out.

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

    From my simulation it looks like rouchly 1% of the population died from the virus?

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

    From my information it looks like roughly 90% of the people vaccinated where saved from the virus.
